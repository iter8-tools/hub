# Iter8 library chart

> This chart provides reusable primitives meant for use in other Iter8 experiment charts. Experiments can be composed by using this chart as a dependency, and by including task templates available in this lib.

**Task templates:** 

- `iter8lib.http`: A template for the `gen-load-and-collect-metrics-http` task
- `iter8lib.grpc`: A template for the `gen-load-and-collect-metrics-grpc` task
- `iter8lib.assess`: A template for the `assess-app-versions` task
